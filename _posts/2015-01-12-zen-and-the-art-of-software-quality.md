Last month, on December 24, I finished reading *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values* by Robert M. Pirsig.

It was my second time reading the book.

The first time I read *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* (which I'll now refer to as *ZAMM*) was in 2002. *ZAMM* explores the concept, meaning, and philosophy of **quality**, which author Pirsig discusses using a form of storytelling that he refers to as Chautaquas:

     I would like to use the time to talk in some depth about things
     that seem important. What is in mind is a sort of Chautauqua — 
     that´s the only name that I can think of for it — like the 
     traveling tent-show Chautauquas that used to move across America,
     […] an old-time series of popular talks intended to edify and 
     entertain, improve the mind and bring culture and enlightenment
     to the ears and thoughts of the hearer. (ZAMM, p.17)

Although I read *ZAMM* from cover to cover in 2002, I raced through the book and I didn't take time to think and reflect about the Chatauquas. I also remember the book being a very boring read for me at the time.

Perhaps I wasn't mentally ready for *ZAMM* in 2002, because when I read it again last month I found myself absorbed in the book.

Which brings me to the purpose of this blog site.

*Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* got me thinking more than usual about the concept and meaning of **quality** with regard to *software quality*. 

My professional career spans more than 15 years in software quality assurance and software testing, and I've never taken the time to write about my experiences in the software quality profession and why I stay on that career path.

Monday, January 12, 2015, seemed like a good time to start writing about it.

Through this blog, I hope others will find it a useful source of knowledge, information, and inspiration.
