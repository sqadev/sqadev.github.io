*Software QA Developer* is a blog about the software quality assurance and software testing side of software development.

I'm Ray Santos and I'm writing to you from San Diego, CA.

This is my personal blog. I started it in January 2015 to document my thoughts, experiences, studies, and adventures in my chosen career of software quality assurance and software testing.

If you live in the U.S. and you've prepared your tax return using commercial software or through a CPA who uses commercial software, chances are pretty high that I've tested components of that software application.

p.s. I study programming as an intellectual hobby. You can read about it at [www.raywritescode.com](http://www.raywritescode.com)

**Question:** Why did you name your blog *Software QA Developer* instead of *Software QA Engineer*?

**Answer:** Because I liked the look of the domain name <code>www.sqadev.com</code> better than <code>www.sqaeng.com</code>
